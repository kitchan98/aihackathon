                "speaker_notes": "In multi-label image classification, the goal is to predict all applicable labels for images that may belong to multiple categories. This is more challenging than standard multi-class classification where only one label needs to be predicted. Data annotation is much more laborious in the multi-label setting since every category must be labeled as present or absent for each image.",

                "speaker_notes": "Single Positive Multi-Label (SPML) learning is a cost-effective solution for multi-label image classification, where models are trained on a single positive label per image. The main challenge in SPML is how to deal with missing labels effectively. Previous approaches like 'Assume Negative' and 'Entropy Maximization' have limitations in handling the missing labels.",

                "speaker_notes": "In this work, we adapt the idea of 'Pseudo Labels' from multi-class image classification to the SPML setting. A 'teacher' network is first trained on single positive labels, and its predictions on the training data are treated as ground-truth labels to train a 'student' network on fully-labeled images. This approach aims to recover as much supervision as possible from the partially labeled data.",

                "speaker_notes": "The Pseudo Multi-Labels algorithm involves training a 'TeacherNet' on the single positive dataset, then using its predictions on the training data to generate 'Pseudo Multi-Labels' by thresholding the predicted probabilities. A 'StudentNet' is then trained on these 'Pseudo Multi-Labels' as if they were fully-labeled data. The threshold parameter controls the strictness of the 'TeacherNet' predictions used for generating positive labels.",
