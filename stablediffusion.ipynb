Among the existing solutions, knowledge distillation stands out due to its outstanding efficiency and generalization. However, existing methods suffer from several drawbacks, including limited knowledge diversity and the lack of rich contextual information. To solve the problems and facilitate the learning of compact language models, we propose \\\\\\\\ours, a novel knowledge distillation paradigm to learn a small student LLM from multiple large teacher LLMs. In particular, we encourage the student LLM to not only generate the correct answers but also understand the rationales behind these answers. Given that different LLMs possess diverse reasoning skills, we guide the student model to assimilate knowledge from various teacher LLMs. We further introduce an in-context example generator and a teacher-forcing Chain-of-Thought strategy to ensure that the rationales are accurate and grounded in contextually appropriate scenarios. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two reasoning tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method. Results show that \\\\\\\\ours can outperform large teacher LLMs significantly, despite having a considerably smaller model size.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\end{abstract}\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\maketitle\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\section{Introduction}\\\\n\\', \\'Large language models (LLMs) have recently taken over various domains and applications, including society ~\\\\\\\\cite{rao2023makes}, education~\\\\\\\\cite{zelikman2023generating}, and scientific understanding~\\\\\\\\cite{beltagy2019scibert}. Despite the success of larger emerging models (GPT-4, Claude-2), their smaller counterparts hardly demonstrate such promising capabilities for performing complex reasoning~\\\\\\\\cite{wei2022emergentabilities,chen2023gotta}. This has been unveiled as the well-known scaling law of LLMs~\\\\\\\\cite{kaplan2020scalinglaws}. As such, it has been desirable to transfer the capabilities of the larger models to the smaller ones so that the smaller ones could be easily deployed while still enjoying the strong capabilities. Previous studies have shown that knowledge distillation is an instrumental tool in mitigating the performance gap between larger models such as LLMs and smaller ones~\\\\\\\\cite{wan2023efficient, hsieh-etal-2023-distilling, kd_survey}. Examples of effective distillation methods include DistilBERT~\\\\\\\\cite{sanh2019distilbert}, Alpaca~\\\\\\\\cite{alpaca} and Vicuna~\\\\\\\\cite{zheng2023judging}.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'However, existing methods suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) \\\\\\\\textbf{Limited Knowledge Diversity}: Current research predominantly employs a single-teacher approach, which confines the learning scope of the student model to the knowledge derived from its own training and architecture designs \\\\\\\\cite{ho2022largelanguagemodels,magister2022teachingsmall,li2023symbolicchain,wang2022pinto}. This means that the student model is limited to the perspectives, biases, and potential weaknesses of the teacher. (2) \\\\\\\\textbf{Lack of Rich Contextual Information}: While rationales play a vital role in effective reasoning \\\\\\\\cite{wei2022chainofthought,kojima2022zero}, current research primarily focuses on leveraging ground truth labels, which indicate the correct answer but do not provide insights into the reasoning and thought process behind that answer.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'In response to the above issues, we propose \\\\\\\\ours, a paradigm that improves the reasoning ability of small student LLMs by distilling knowledge from multiple large teacher LLMs with rationale guidance. Specifically, \\\\\\\\ours mitigates the limited knowledge diversity issue by involving multiple teacher models as \\\\\\\\textit{co-advisors}. To fully exploit each teacher model and mitigate the lack of rich contextual information problem, \\\\\\\\ours asks the teacher for the rationales to support the answers. By learning from multiple teachers, the student model can inherit a broader range of skills and knowledge, leading to better generalization capabilities. In addition, to ensure the rationales are grounded in contextually appropriate scenarios and reflect the true underlying reasoning procedure, \\\\\\\\ours features an in-context example generator and a teacher-forcing Chain-of-Thought strategy, making the teachers understand the task through demonstrations and generate the accurate rationales.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'To thoroughly assess our approach, we conduct experiments on six datasets in commonsense and biomedical reasoning tasks. The results show that the usage of our paradigm enhances performance by \\\\\\\\textbf{+5.07\\\\\\\\%} to \\\\\\\\textbf{+12.57\\\\\\\\%} compared to full fine-tuning with significantly smaller model size, i.e., \\\\\\\\textbf{1.1\\\\\\\\%} to \\\\\\\\textbf{26.0\\\\\\\\%} of teacher sizes. We also perform ablation studies to demonstrate the validity of teacher rationales and undertake hyperparameter analyses for a comprehensive evaluation.

However, this method faces challenges due to limitations in computational resources at the inference stage, especially because rationales must be pre-generated for every data sample in both training and test sets~\\\\\\\\cite{wang2022pinto}. To overcome this issue, we employ rationales as a form of supervisory signal during the training process to develop a model that is adept at generating its own explanations. Subsequently, this trained model can be utilized on the test set, eliminating the need for pre-generated rationales to facilitate accurate reasoning. Specifically, \\\\\\\\ours integrates rationales from multiple teacher models into a unified multi-task instruction tuning framework. This necessitates the assignment of a unique prefix \\\\\\\\(p\\\\\\\\) for distinguishing between learning tasks from different teachers. The student model is trained not only to predict labels but also to generate rationales akin to those produced by the teachers. Accordingly, the overall loss function $\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}$ is as follows:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\begin{equation}\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_A + \\\\\\\\sum_{m=1}^{M}\\\\\\\\alpha^m\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{T^m}, \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\label{eq:total_loss}\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\end{equation}\\\\n\\', \\'where \\\\\\\\(\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_A\\\\\\\\) denotes the objective of learning from ground truth answers, $\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{T^m}$ indicates the objective of learning from $m$-th teacher, $\\\\\\\\alpha^m$ is the importance weight for $T^m$, and $M$ is the number of teacher LLMs. Formally, $\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_A$ and $\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{T^m}$ are defined as follows:\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\begin{equation}\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_A = \\\\\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\\\\\ell(S(Q_i, O_i, p_A; \\\\\\\\theta_S), A_i),\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\end{equation}\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\begin{equation}\\\\n\\', \\'    \\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_{T^m} = \\\\\\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\\\\\\\ell(S(Q_i, O_i, p_m; \\\\\\\\theta_S), R_i^m),\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\end{equation}\\\\n\\', \\'where $N$ is the number of data samples, $\\\\\\\\ell$ indicates the cross-entropy loss between the predicted and target tokens. Here $\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_A$ encourages the student $S$ to generate ground truth answer $A_i$ by minimizing the difference between it and the student output given the question $Q_i$, options $O_i$, and instruction prefix $p_A$ for generating answers. On the other hand, $\\\\\\\\mathcal{L}_T^m$ facilitates the student $S$ to mimic the reasoning capability of teacher $T^m$ by learning from its rationale $R_i^m$, with the guidance of instruction prefix $p_m$ for $T^m$.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\section{Experiments}\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\subsection{Experimental Setup}\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\textbf{Datasets.} \\\\n\\', \\'We follow the setup in GNP \\\\\\\\cite{gnp} for the usage of commonsense reasoning and biomedical reasoning datasets, including OpenBookQA (OBQA)~\\\\\\\\cite{OpenBookQA2018}, The AI2 Reasoning Challenge (ARC)~\\\\\\\\cite{Clark2018ThinkYH}, Physical Interaction Question Answering (PIQA)~\\\\\\\\cite{Bisk2020PIQA}, RiddleSense (Riddle)~\\\\\\\\cite{lin-etal-2021-riddlesense}, PubMedQA (PQA)~\\\\\\\\cite{jin2019pubmedqa}, and BioASQ~\\\\\\\\cite{Tsatsaronis2015BIOASQ}.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\noindent \\\\\\\\textbf{Baselines.} \\\\n\\', \"We benchmark \\\\\\\\ours against the teacher\\'s performance and various training approaches, including an Inference configuration without training, an efficient training method LoRA \\\\\\\\cite{hu2022lora} that updates a subset of parameters, and the full fine-tuning that updates all the parameters in the student.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\\\\\noindent \\\\\\\\textbf{Implementation Details.} For \\\\\\\\ours, we set the learning rate to \\\\\\\\(5 \\\\\\\\times 10^{-5}\\\\\\\\), batch size to 16, maximum input length to 1024, and epoch to 1.

            "['Welcome to our presentation on TinyLLM, a novel approach to learning small student language models from multiple large teacher language models. The motivation behind our work is the increasing need for deploying flexible and less expensive language models without compromising their reasoning capabilities. Large language models have shown remarkable success across various domains, but their deployment is often hindered by their size and the computational resources they require.', 'Our research identifies two main problems with existing methods of distilling knowledge into smaller models: limited knowledge diversity and the lack of rich contextual information. By relying on a single teacher model, previous approaches have confined the learning scope of the student model, limiting its potential. Furthermore, the absence of rationale behind the correct answers has been a significant gap in effective reasoning and understanding.', 'To address these challenges, we introduce TinyLLM, a paradigm that leverages knowledge from multiple large teacher models to enhance the reasoning ability of a small student model. Our method not only focuses on generating the correct answers but also on understanding the rationales behind these answers. This approach allows the student model to inherit a broader range of skills and knowledge, leading to better generalization capabilities.']\n",
